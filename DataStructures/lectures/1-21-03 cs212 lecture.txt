Close the database reading and writing

Let the if statement check the file lenght
Input from args, when it is running, or hard code

FileReader and BufferedReader
File class


What class is he going over?

What can't we changed in Project 1?
  - can't change the method signature
  - run method has a boolean method as a parameter [extra]
  - run decides what thread to run
  - makes it more complicated if you run a boolean method
  - put all thread methods inside the run method
  
  OptimalThread.run(boolean?)
  - checking which one is called
  calc and run(boolean) is something
  
  Need to sychronize if you don't use sleep method of the thread
  
  Setting the priorities for threads
  cannot change datatype of the run, but we can pass as many parameters as we want
  think of it as the main method with run
  
  applet versus application
  there is a main in GUIs, but applet must reside in a broswer
  
  IMPORTANT
  Learn how to read a file
  Learn how to minipulate file
  LearN how to write to a file
  
  InputStreamReader <- this is keyboard input
  FileReader <- this is the reads a file for input
  
  init and applet is like the 'run method'
  
  If you want to read another database, you must learn how to use JBDC?
  Creating a csv file we must include a comma.  NO!
  
  Must use try and catch when opening a file
  
  Can we still get extra credit?
  The way we wrote is fundamental
  
  Every week, we go little by little.  Learn what is posted, then move on
  String class, use the substring to trim
  
  Harding going and passing arguments through JBuilder.  That is always fun
  We can now pass methods and Objects Cool!
  Great, the delimiters!
