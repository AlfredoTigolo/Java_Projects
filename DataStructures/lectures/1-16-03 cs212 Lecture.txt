jupiter/tmp/grades.csv
subsititue customers.csv with grades.csv

Xtra credit -> create a class called 
	class dataThread { }
	- file: String
	pulic vod+getData (String filename) { show the data }
	//most of the work is down in get data
	public void run()
	
	//what does the run method do in this class?
	method called getFinal has two strings
	  - student name
	  - final grade

Driver:
	- create 2 objects of type dataThread
	- start the thread
	- run the thread
	* both threads are unsync -> need to synchronize

So, far, we have two assignments.
	For Customer.csv,
	Create a class that does the following.
	Read the file and tokenize it?
	Then, only show the people in Germany.
	
	If you create a thread and access one object, there is no problem reading.
	But, the only time you will have trouble is writing.
	
	what does lock on an object mean?  Means, the thread is synchronized so that thread
	has to finish first before the other threads can run.
	How do we get the thread to start each thread.
	Create a method that does the task you want.
	Read into a table, minuplate the data, and display the answer.
	Eugene, what is the answer Eugene?
	The Grades.csv calculates the average, the other calculates the sum.
	
Synchronized modifier
	Only applies to methods, Only one thread at a time can execute this method.
